	<h3>Crop Insurance</h3>

	<p>
		Affiliated with the AgroLogic, a highly rated leading innovator of crop insurance since 1980, we are now able to assist our customers with the ever-changing needs for crop insurance.
	</p>

	<p>
		In today's environment, we realize that producers face volatile risks in the rapidly changing business structure of the Agriculture Industry. Along with new technology and changing weather patterns, these changes present daily challenges to anyone growing a crop or raising livestock.
	</p>

	<p>
		Changes in national farm policy mean that producers must assume more of their own farming risk. The Multi-Peril Crop Insurance Program is one of the producer's best remaining safety nets. With federal incentives that significantly reduce premiums, crop insurance is one of the wisest purchases a producer can make.
